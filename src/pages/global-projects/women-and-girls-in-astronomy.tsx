                from around the world to celebrate and highlight the

                This global event, organised by the IAU Office for Astronomy
                Outreach, aims to inspire new generations, promote gender equity
                in science, and foster a more inclusive astronomical community.
                Through workshops, talks, and participatory activities, we
                connect stories, discoveries, and dreams that remind us the
                Universe is open to everyone.
