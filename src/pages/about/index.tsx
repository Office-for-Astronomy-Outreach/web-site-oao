        <p>The IAU Office for Astronomy Outreach (OAO) is a joint project of the International Astronomical Union (IAU) and the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan (NAOJ), under the auspices of the National Institutes of Natural Sciences (NINS) of Japan. The office is based in Tokyo, at the NAOJ Mitaka Campus.</p>

        <p>The mission of the OAO is to engage the public in astronomy through access to astronomical information and communication of the science of astronomy. This is implemented through a network of IAU National Outreach Coordinators (NOCs) and the IAUâ€™s engagement initiatives with the public, encouraging active communication of science through IAU member public engagement, professional-amateur, and citizen science activities.</p>

        <p>The work of the OAO is about building bridges between the IAU and the global astronomy community of amateur astronomers, outreach practitioners, educators, communicators, and the general public, and through international collaboration, to make the science of astronomy accessible to all.</p>
