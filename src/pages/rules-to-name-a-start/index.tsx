                  buy or name stars (or any other astronomical object). Some

                  Some bright stars have proper names, often with Arabic, Greek,
                  or Latin etymologies (e.g., Vega). However, the vast majority
                  of stars have alphanumeric designations consisting of an
                  acronym plus either an index number or celestial position
                  (e.g., HR 7001, 2MASS J18365633+3847012)

                <p>
                  As an international scientific organization, the IAU
                  completely dissociates itself from the commercial practice of
                  &quot;selling&quot; fictitious star names, surface feature
                  names, or extraterrestrial real estate. The IAU does not
                  maintain a list of the competing businesses that claim to
                  offer such services. Those seeking to contact such enterprises
                  should refer to commercial directories in their respective
                  countries.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Some businesses have misleadingly suggested that the IAU is
                  associated with, recognizes, or approves their activities. The
                  IAU makes it clear that any such claims are false. If you come
                  across unauthorized use of the IAU&apos;s name, please report
                  it to us with supporting documentation.
